# HaX

**HaX** is the name of a markup language. 
A parser 'hax.py' converts HaX to XML, HTML or XHTML.


## Objective

Edit XML- or HTML5-files with less energy. HaX-tags are shortcuts for XML-tags. 

For example:

XML: `<p class="alert" title="I should pop up">An example</h1>â€¢`

HaX: `<p.alert@T="I should pop up" An example>`

So:
  - endtag is nameless;
  - attribunames can be reduced to symbol ('.' in example) or short name ('T' in example).

These symbols and short names are defined in a JSON-file, which can be changed to everybody's preferences.

So: *nothing is fixed in hax*.

HaX is a generic markup language, and does not focus on a specific type of documents. Markdown is used to edit articles,
but with HaX you can edit anything. 

## Last but not least

HaX can be mixed with regular XML or (X)HTML. In fact: XML or HTML is also HaX.
